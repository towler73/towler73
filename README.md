- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
     - how good organizations run by listening to [IdealCast](https://itrevolution.com/the-idealcast-podcast/)
     - where I can use Clojure more.  e.g. creating a re-frame ledger interface.
     - Using Jupyter Notebooks in processing pipeline
     - Visualizing data, d3, matplotlib.
     - how to help my kids in math, SymPy :)
